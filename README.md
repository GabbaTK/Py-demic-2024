# Py-demic

This is a program made to simulate the spreading of a virus through a population.

Although the name may make you think the program was made in python, it is not, it was made in python but now it is made in C#.

Here you have the original python code which will not be updated anymore and the visual studio C# code which you can modify or compile yourself.
